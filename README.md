# boostGauge
Arduino boost gauge using an Adafruit NeoPixel.

This is a personal project at making a 52mm boost gauge for my vehicle.  It is powered by an arduino uno.  The physical design includes an adafruit neopixel, two seven segment displays on 50/50 duty cycle, and a yet to be determined pressure sensor.

Ring Matrix is a library that I created to manage the neopixel meter.  It is a derivative of a circular array that is designed to hold all of the values of each LED.
